Enter a number between 0 - 100 until you get the right number, everytime you guess the  wrong number the Min OR Max number range
changes depending on if the number you entered is larger or smaller than the correct number, you get 10 chances. 

E.g you entered 65 and the correct number was 70 the number range is now from 65 - 100
